# ðŸ“š Virtual Book Club

Our project will be an online book club organizer. We want people to be able to create gated book clubs so that they can ensure a safe community with people they know. We would also like to use an API to allow easier searching for books to read. We will also create a system to help the club decide what book to read next. We wanted to bring a community together within the club, so weâ€™ll allow calendar events to allow virtual/in-person events.
